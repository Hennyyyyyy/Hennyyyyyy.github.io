title: Day 2
---

Today is day 2 of my project. I successfully installed both pygame and tkinter on my computer today and I plan to run it with visual studio code. Installing these took a little longer than expected as I was first on powershell instead of command prompt and then I used a wrong keyword. Plenty of annoying stuff. I started coding blackjack today on colab, it is A LOT harder than I expected. So many functions to define and to organize, so many variables to keep track of. Each hand dealt in the game needs to have a visual and a value that are different from each other! Blackjack might take a day longer than expected, but I think that is fine as long as I work hard.
