title: Day 2
---

Today is day 2 of my project. I successfully installed both pygame and tkinter on my computer today and I plan to run it with visual studio code. Installing these took a little longer than expected as I was first on powershell instead of command prompt and then I used a wrong keyword. Plenty of annoying stuff. I started coding blackjack today on colab, it is A LOT harder than I expected. So many functions to define and to organize, so many variables to keep track of. Each hand dealt in the game needs to have a visual and a value that are different from each other! Blackjack might take a day longer than expected, but I think that is fine as long as I work hard. I think instead of finishing blackjack then learning pygame and tkinter, I will do both simultaniously to hopefully save some time and get some progress on both the GUI and the game. The biggest problems in blackjack right now are Aces having 2 values and spltting your hand. I can probably figure out the Ace problem pretty easily with a few conditionals but I have 0 idea what to do for splitting. Maybe my game will lack the function to split your hand, which sucks, but if I can't come up with a solution in time I will have to abandon it in order to complete the project.
