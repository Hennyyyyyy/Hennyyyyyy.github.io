title: Day 6
---

Very good progress today. I am surprised that I got so much done even after going to church. I made all of my buttons functional today and even added functions to allow you to continously play the game. Although that part is not functional yet, I am pretty confident I can get it to work no problem tommorow or even later today. I also found that there is unicode for card art. So, if I can change the font size of my text widgets in Tkinter, it sould be real easy to display cards. All I would need is a dictionary to convert all my cards into unicode. One thing I regret not doing is adding testing for all of my code. Although I am still able to determine what is wrong very quickly, adding testing probably would've made everything smoother. A lot of my docstrings are empty rightnow as well, so I would like to finish those sometime later as well. With only 3 days left in my project, the progress I made today was very crucial and I need to keep this work ethic up for the next three days. I feel like I would be able to get a lot more work done today if it weren't for exploravision. The paper is technically due today and I haven't done like anything yet. So, I will [unfortunantly] have to spend the rest of my day working on that. While I do have a free period tommorow, I likely need to dedicate most, if not all of that time to my english reflection paper, which I also haven't done yet. :) With the time I have tommorow, I would like to make my code fully functional without visuals. Then, I can spend Tuesday adding visuals and polishing my code along with creating a presentation for this project.
