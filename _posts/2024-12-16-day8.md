title: Day 8
---

Last day working on the project and nothing much to be done today. I uploaded my code to github. I think I just have to link it at the bottom of this page and go write my tips section. I don't really know what to write, I just finished my math final. It was pretty hard, hopefully I pass. I think I will work on my presentation a little more after finishing my last blog. Afterall, my presentation is graded by my classmates. I have to make it interesting and fun. I don't think that'll be too hard because I did make a game after all. Games are supposed to be fun. Hopefully, I have a few gambling addicts in my class that will give my presentation positive reviews.

I doubled check all of my documentation today for all of my code. My doc strings were pretty short because I used global variables and had no arguments to enter. Hopefully, Lux doesn't take money points off on that. Bye bye blog!

Update: EMERGENCY! Just realized people can still hit stand double and fold after game ends. Imagine if I didn't catch this and showed it to class tommorow... Good thing I caught it. My plan is to move the button disappearing code more up so it executes before any button presses. Hopefully I remember to update the file on Github as well.

To be safe, here is both the permalink and the path.
