Hello, I am writing this to a future student in the Programming Fundementals Class. While it makes more sense for me to link all of my trainings and missions (you'll find out what does are) for you to copy, that wouldn't benefit you at all. Programming is very fun as long as you approach it with the right mindset and attitude. Programming is like an art, a lot of the times, there is no right answer. Two people can have completely different functions that accomplish the same goal in the end. The code you program shows your personal thought process on how to approach the given task, and this is why I believe copying code is useless for beginners. 

During the start of class, I was very stubborn with how my code worked, and I was afraid to make mistakes. Programming class taught me to not be afraid to make mistakes, especially in a class meant for beginners. During my final project, I had to learn how to use a completely new library. I messed up a lot. Even with lots of tutorials, I was still having trouble getting the basic concepts. But a growth mindset helped me make progress and I think I am a lot more proficient now.

I think the most important things for programming are patience and a growth mindset. Some concepts are harder to grasp then others. Don't compare yourself, especially because some people might've learned programming before. Let everything come to you at your pace. I wish you the best of luck on your programming journey.
